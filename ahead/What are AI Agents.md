This 12 minutes video start with "2024 is the year of AI Agent". Can not agreed more! I like presentation of AI Agent concept in a very simple way. One key point noted: For simple queries, do not use Agent as they are costly, in terms of time and computational resources. What is your a key take away from the video?
